# üìû Hi There

We are **Team-2**, comprised of three members: Amir Maharjan, Byamadorj Burentogtokh, and Santosh Pokhrel. We are excited to embark on a full-stack project named **XMPOS ACCELERATE**, under the supervision of Dr. Ayesha Binte Ashfaq, a senior professor at Swinburne University of Technology, Sydney Campus.

***

## ‚òûPurpose

**XMPOS Accelerate** is a centralized control plane designed to ease and accelerate the process of performing redundant tasks assigned to the XMPOS team, such as WordPress deployments, IAM roles and policy updates, and infrastructure provisioning. The primary goals of the XMPOS Accelerate are:

- **Efficient Infrastructure Deployment:** Automate the deployment of various infrastructure components, including WordPress applications in monolithic, distributed, managed, or highly available flavors.
- **Authentication:** Enable secure login and access control using Amazon Cognito for the XMPOS team members, ensuring a reliable and secure authentication mechanism.
- **User-Friendly Front-End:** Provide an intuitive and user-friendly front-end interface for team members to manage deployment options and access relevant information.
- **Centralized Deployment Control:** Allow the XMPOS team to centralize and control the deployment process, making it easy to manage deployments across different types of infrastructure.

 ## ‚úçÔ∏èFeature Details

### Front-End:

1. **Login:**
   - Utilize Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization.
   - Implement secure login features with multi-factor authentication for enhanced security.
2. **Dashboard Overview:**
   - Display an overview of ongoing and completed deployments.
   - Provide quick access to deployment options and configuration settings.
3. **Deployment Options:**

### Back-End:

1. **Terraform Infrastructure Deployment:**
   - Implement Terraform scripts for automated infrastructure provisioning.
   - Support deployment scenarios for WordPress applications, microservices, monolithic applications, Lightsail instances, and High Availability setups.
   - Secure backend APIs to trigger Terraform scripts for infrastructure provisioning.
2. **Integration with AWS Services:**
   - Integrate with various AWS services for infrastructure provisioning, such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, VPC configurations, etc.
3. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Implement logging and monitoring features for tracking deployment activities.
   - Utilize AWS CloudWatch or similar services for centralized log management.
4. **Deployment History:**
   - Maintain a historical record of past deployments for auditing and reference purposes.
   - Include deployment details, timestamps, and associated parameters.
